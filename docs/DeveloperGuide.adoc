By: `Team ???`      Since: `Jun 2016`      Licence: `NUS`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::privilege[]
=== Privilege Feature
[[fig-PrivilegeDiagram]]
.Structure of the Privilege Component
image::Privilege.png[width="800"]

==== Current Implementation
Logic is assigned to one Privilege object at all times. Privilege contains a User and a Person.
The User interface defines what access level the Privilege object have, which is implemented by BasicUser, TutorUser and AdminUser. +
BasicUser is the class with the lowest access level, and the ancestor to other 2 User classes. +
To create an increasing level of access, each User of a higher level inherits from the successively lower one. +
Each User level have their own list of new commands they can run, which is appended to the list inherited from their parent. +
Account class, which contains its respective Privilege object, is the way to assign a privilege level to a Person. +
Account also holds authentication details required for logging in. + 
When switching Privilege levels, the Privilege attached to Logic will point its UserType and myPerson to that in the desired Privilege level, as seen below in the Object Diagram and Sequence Diagram. +

[[fig-PrivilegeObjectDiagram]]
.How switching Privilege is implemented (Object Diagram)

[[fig-LoginSequenceDiagram]]
.Sequence Diagram for Login Command
image::Login_Sequence_Diagram.png[width="600"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to define a privilege level of Privilege

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Instantiate User's of the different access level. Privilege contains an enum UserType which point to each of these instantiated object.
** Pros: Allow us to make use of inheritance to organize the list (higher access level User's list of allowed commands will always be a superset of that of a lower access level). +
The usage of enums also allows us to keep a reference to the created User object, which allows us to point back to these object if need be, rather than having to instantiate new ones each time.
** Cons: Requires the use of User class to represent the different access levels
* **Alternative 2:** Use an enum to indicate the current access level. List of allowed commands will be generated base on the value of this enum.
** Pros: Does not require a separate class to represent the different access levels.
** Cons: Difficult to maintain the list of allowed commands. 
* **Alternative 3:** Use a String to determine the Privilege level.
** Pros: Easy to implement and parse.
** Cons: Very prone to undetected bugs, like mispelling the Privilege levels.

===== Aspect: How to define the access level required by the command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each User holds a list of commands they can run
** Pros: Easy to maintain the list of commands a User can run (just an Command Array).
** Cons: Difficult to find what access level a command requires. Requires looping through the array to find the presence of the given command.

* **Alternative 2:** Each command knows what access level is required to run it
** Pros: Easy to find what access level a command requires
** Cons: Difficult to see what commands a given User can run. Difficult to organize the commands by their required access level.

* **Alternative 3:** Have both 1 and 2
** Pros: Doing both the above operation becomes easy
** Cons: Difficult to maintain both information. Access level information is now stored in 2 separate locations and needs to be in sync


===== Aspect: How to update the privilege of Logic given an Account to log into

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The Privilege object attached to Logic will copy the User and the Person attached to the given Account object, into its own user and myPerson respectively.
** Pros: Does not require the Command to interact with Logic, thus reducing coupling.
** Cons: A bit more awkward solution than the Alternative 2
* **Alternative 2:** Change Logic to point to the new Privilege object inside of Account.
** Pros: Quick to implement.
** Cons: Higher level of coupling compared to Alternative 1. Also, would require storing or instantiating a default Privilege and making Logic point to this new object if Logout Command were to be called. 

===== Aspect: Default required access levels for commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Access level is set to Admin by default
** Pros: If a developer forgets to give access level to a Command, it will to still be functional.
** Cons: May mask the fact that the Command have the unintended access level of Admin.

* **Alternative 2:** Enforce all Commands to be assigned a access level
** Pros: Forces delevopers to be deliberate with their access level assignment to commands
** Cons: Program will fail to integrate if any of the developer forgot to assign an access level to their newly developed commands.

===== Aspect: Who throws InsufficientPrivilege Exception

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Logic throws the Exception
** Pros: It is a common starting point of commands, so it is easy to implement it to throw the Exception
** Cons: Blurs the responsiblity of commands being the one throwing the Exception

* **Alternative 2:** Each Command checks the Privilege level during execute()
** Pros: Keeps to the responsibility of Commands being the one to throw the Exception when they are being executed
** Cons: Requires backdating all the commands to include this function in their execute(). Also prone to errors as a developer may forget to call this function in their execute() of their newly developed Commands.

* **Alternative 3:** Have a function that checks the Privilege level in parent Command that is called during execute()
** Pros: Same as 2.
** Cons: Same as 2, but instead of using individual functions, we are repeatedly using the inherited function instead
// end::privilege[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have one type of test:

.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
